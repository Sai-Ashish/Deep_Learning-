The architecture specified in slide 21 has been implemented and code is there in 2CNNLayers_SGD

2CNNLayers_SGD has been implemented by using stochastic gradient descent

1CNNLayer_BGD has been implemented by using batch gradient descent

The activation map have been shown on a scale of 28,28 thus they appear to be shrinked

And also the layer appears to extracting the edges initially
