PLEASE RUN THE CODES IN PYTHON 2

for displaying kernels filters i have printed the weights on the terminal

for changing the parameters go to the main code at the bottom of every code and change the parameters

ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION HAS BEEN GIVEN AS COMMENTS IN THE CODE PLEASE GO THROUGH THEM

NOTE:

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN QN1 AND QN3 IS THERE IS ONLY ONE FILTER WITH DEPTH = IMAGE DEPTH IN QN1 AND IN QN3 THERE ARE MULTIPLE FILTERS WITH DEPTH = IMAGE DEPTH SO THE CODE IS THE SAME WITH NUMBEROF FILTERS IN QN1 SET TO 1

SIMILARLY FOR POOLING TOO
